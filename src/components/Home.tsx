      <p>
        As a <i>Registered Dietitian</i> since 2014, I've enjoyed working with
        others and helping improve others' health through lifestyle changes and
        nutrition education.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, I am looking for work opportunities to keep learning and growing as
        a <i>Software Engineer</i>. Time passes by so quickly with building
        projects, creating applications, and using new technologies. I would
        like to continue helping others with my newfound passion in technology.
      </p>

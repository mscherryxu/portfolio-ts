        Born in <span className="city">New York, New York</span> and raised in{" "}
        <span className="city">Brooklyn, NY</span> by parents who immigrated to

      <p>
        I enjoy learning and speaking in different languages. I also enjoy
        eating foods from various cultures. Growing up, I mostly spoke in{" "}
        <b>Cantonese</b> at home with my family, and I learned <b>English</b>{" "}
        from school and watching TV.
      </p>
      <p>
        I learned <b>Mandarin</b> at my first dietitian role in Flushing to
        communicate with clients, and I picked up <b>Spanish</b> from my
        colleagues and patients at a nursing and rehabilitation facility I
        worked at.
